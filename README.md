# Gunlister

A simplistic overview of firearms that any Texas owner would want. Why go to multiple websites to find out any information about a particular firearm you want. THEN go to ANOTHER website to know how much it costs, when you can simply view this Gunlister and all the information is right here available for you. 

# How to use 
When first viewing the Gunlister,you are able to look at all the submitted guns that other users have posted without logging in. However, to add your own ad and expand the database you need to register and sign in as a user. After doing so, you'll be able to update your user info, submit ads, update and delete your ads, as well as see your ads on your profile page. 

# Development Process
